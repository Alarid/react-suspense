# Render as you fetch

## Background

This one's a bit of a mind bender, but here's the ultimate goal we're looking
for: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1191922859762843649

We wont get the whole way there in this exercise, but we'll get a bunch of the
way there. Then in exercise 04 we can finish it up. So fast âš¡

The idea here is that: get the data as soon as you have the information you need
for the data. This sounds obvious, but if you think about it, how often do you
have a component that requests data once it's been mounted. There's a few
milliseconds between the time you click "go" and the time that component is
mounted... Unless that component's code is lazy-loaded. In which case, there's a
lot more time involved and your users are hanging around waiting while they
could be making requests for the data they need.

That's the entire idea behind "Render as you fetch."

The information often involves a user's

## Exercise

In this one, we now have a form that allows us to choose a pokemon by any name.
As soon as the user hits "submit", we have all we need to make a request for
that pokemon's data. So in our event handler, we'll create a pokemon resource
and store that resource in state. Remember, the act of creating the resource is
what fires off the async request. So we've started it as early as possible.

When our component re-renders, it renders our `PokemonInfo` component within
suspense and error boundaries which take over until the resource promise
resolves.

If you'd like, you can also try the `src/exercises/02-effect.js` file. In that
one, your task is to refactor it from `useEffect` to Suspense with resources.

## Extra Credit

So far, we've benefitted from an API standpoint. I think the Suspense solution
is simpler than the `useEffect` version. However, we've not gotten the "Render
as you fetch" benefit when it comes to asynchronously loading the code we need.

These extra credit allow you to compare the two approaches.

ðŸ¦‰ For both of these, it's recommended that you call
`window.fetch.restoreOriginalFetch()` at the top of your file so your fetch
requests actually hit the network so you can see them in the network tab.

### ðŸ’¯ lazy load pokemon-info-fetch-on-render

For this one, you'll be working in `src/exercises/02-effect.js`. If you've
already edited this file, reset it by running:

```
git checkout src/exercises/02-effect.js
```

Now, you can completely delete the `PokemonInfo` component and instead do this:

```javascript
const PokemonInfo = React.lazy(() =>
  import('../lazy/pokemon-info-fetch-on-render-02'),
)
```

That should be all you need to do to get going. Pull up the Network tab and
watch the waterfall when you select a pokemon.

### ðŸ’¯ lazy load pokemon-info-render-as-you-fetch

For this one, you'll be working in `src/exercises/02.js`. You'll need to have
finished the exercise first before this will work.

Now, you can completely delete the `PokemonInfo` component and instead do this:

```javascript
const PokemonInfo = React.lazy(() =>
  import('../lazy/pokemon-info-render-as-you-fetch-02'),
)
```

But that's not all. One of the nice things about the `useEffect` version is that
the code for fetching the data is colocated with the code that needs the data.
This is why we often "Fetch on render" naturally. But we can have our colocation
goodness and our "Render as you fetch" too by putting that code in a separate
file. I've already done this for you, so at the top of the file, add this
import:

```javascript
import createPokemonInfoResource from '../lazy/pokemon-info-render-as-you-fetch-02.data'
```

Then where you're calling `setPokemonResource` do this:
`setPokemonResource(createPokemonResource(newPokemonName))` and checkout the
network tab. Compare that to the "Fetch on render approach"
